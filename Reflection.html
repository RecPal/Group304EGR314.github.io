        Reflection
    </contenthead>
    <contentparagraph>
Overall, our group learned a lot from this project. If we were to repeat this project with out current knowledge or advise another 
student going into this project, there are a handful of points we would make sure to emphasize. First and most importantly: Tasks will rarely
/never go according to plan the first time you attempt it, expect your first attempt to be a rough draft and leave yourself enough time to revise
and debug. Secondly, lay out the circuits you plan to include on your PCB on a breadboard before submitting your PCB design. It's important to
verify that your circuit layout is functional before you put money down on a PCB order. Third, try to have your project work done 36 hours before the 
submission deadline at minimum, as you will likely need time to troubleshoot or help your team mates. Fourth, keep your project as simple 
as you can. Minimize the components used and PCB trace width & via use. The less stuff on your board, the less places there are for errors to occur. Lastly,
don't be afraid to ask students from other groups for help. The professors and TAs in this class are very stretched thin and this class is tough.
Most of the students in this course have to contend with the same issues as you, so they will likely be able to help you.
