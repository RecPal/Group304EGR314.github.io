# What is the goal of our exhibit?

## <span style="color: red">*Our goal is to create an exhibit that demonstrates the basic mechanics behind heavier-than-air flight using small-scale wind tunnel that includes multiple adjustable variables, simulating various flight conditions.*</span>

# Who is our audience?
## <span style="color: red">*Our target audience is 5th-8th grade students, since most students are taught the basic principles behind flight during those grades. Our exhibit will serve as a demonstration of what the students learned in class or as an introduction to something they will learn soon.*</span>
