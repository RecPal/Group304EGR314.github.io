# What is the goal of our exhibit?

## <span style="color: red">*Our goal is to create an exhibit that demonstrates the basic mechanics behind heavier-than-air flight using small-scale wind tunnel that includes multiple adjustable variables, simulating various flight conditions.*</span>

# Who is our audience?
## <span style="color: red">*Our target audience is 5th-8th grade students, since most students are taught the basic principles behind flight during those grades. Our exhibit will serve as a demonstration of what the students learned in class or as an introduction to something they will learn soon.*</span>

# The why
## How the features in our concept sketch satisfies the needs of museum visitors

*The interactive wind tunnel exhibit is tailored to provide an engaging and educational experience for museum visitors, particularly 5th–8th grade students. The exhibit bridges theoretical learning with practical application by demonstrating the mechanics of heavier-than-air flight, offering an introduction or reinforcement of classroom topics. Adjustable variables allow visitors to explore different flight conditions, making the exhibit dynamic and appealing. Additionally, the design ensures accessibility for a wide audience, thanks to its user-friendly interface, and minimizes disruption by incorporating resettable features to prevent interference from previous users. These considerations make the exhibit both intuitive and impactful for visitors.*

## How the functionality will be split across four teammates

1. Internet-Based Two-Way Communication (Dominick)

   Dominick can oversee the development of features that allow real-time data sharing and connectivity. These include enabling visitors to compare their results online or integrating the exhibit with a remote server to store and analyze user interactions.

2. Human-Machine Interface via Screen and Buttons (Adam)	

   Adam can handle the creation of the user interface, including touchscreens or physical buttons for adjusting variables like wind speed or wing angles. The exhibit controls will be clearly labeled in order to ensure that interactions with the exhibit are straightforward. These interfaces will make the exhibit interactive and intuitive for all users.

3. Sensor and Actuator-Based Controlled Response (Emerson)

   Emerson can focus on integrating sensors and actuators to adjust and measure wind tunnel conditions. This includes using sensors to detect user inputs and actuators to modify airflow or simulate different flight conditions.

4. Overall Exhibit Coordination and Documentation (Cory)

   Cory can ensure the seamless integration of all components, They will document the process and troubleshooting issues. Additionally, they can manage the reset functionality to maintain the exhibit’s usability and safety for all visitors.
