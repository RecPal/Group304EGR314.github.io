    <contentParagraph>
        When chosing our team's project we looked at various different options.
        Our priorities were twofold, ease of manufacturing as well as prioritizing educational
        benefit. It was critically important to our team that we develop a fun and engaging platform
        for students, while not overscoping to the point that we cannot make meaningful progress.

                <contentParagraph>
                    Our initial thought process was to just try to get as many ideas down on paper as possible.

                    <p></p>

                    In it's initial state, we decided on categorizing our ideas exclusively based on who came up with
                    them.
                    It ensured we had equal representation from all group members, and let everyone come up with ideas
                    independent
                    of the influence of others. Once all ideas were compiled, we would go forward categorizing them into
                    useful identifiers.

                    Our team decided to categorize our ideas by categorizing them by type.

                    <p></p>

                    We decided to break down our ideas down into 4 distinct categories

                    <p></p>

                    <b>User interfacing :</b>
                    <p class="close-Space">
                        Any operator input/output. Ways for the operator to communicate with the machine, and ways for
                        the machine to communicate with the operator.
                    </p>

                    <p></p>

                    <b>Features :</b>
                    <p class="close-Space">
                        Exhibit features. Anything interesting or novel we can do to push the envelope or optimize our
                        system. This category
                        primarily encompasses things we think may be interesting to make, as opposed to ideas that
                        specifically target the
                        project goals.
                    </p>

                    <p></p>

                    <b>Education :</b>
                    <p class="close-Space">
                        Ideas that promote the educational aspect of our project. This is arguably the most important
                        category, as it encompasses
                        possible educational lessons we could instill through our work. This category's selections will
                        have the greatest influence
                        on the other ideation choices, as it scopes the project to a specified goal.
                    </p>

                    <p></p>

                    <b>Entertainment :</b>
                    <p class="close-Space">
                        Our final category is entertainment. This category encompasses all ideas that we deemed "Fun".
                        Trying to incorporate these into the project is far from a priority, but it would certainly help
                        keep the user entertained.
                        And an entertained user is more likely to spend the time required at the exhibit to benefit from
                        it's educational lesson.
                    </p>

    <contentHead> Final Selection </contentHead>
    <contentParagraph>
        <p class="close-Space">
            Our final selection criteria was held to a vote. We all picked ideas made by others, and allowed other
            members to
            critique our own. After determining the favored ideas, we started to decided which of the educational goals
            we could
            reach while trying to execute on our desired goals. This led to our final decision, which we deemed a
            simulated wind tunnel.
